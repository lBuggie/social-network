# Social Network concept

> This is a website for a responsive social network based on a design by [Vlad Ermakov](https://dribbble.com/ermalength).

The basic requirements for this project include having:

- The person detail page, with a link to the next/previous person detail and a link to the chat page.
- The chat page, with a list of chats that link to the chat detail page.
- The chat detail page.

Each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes: 

- Mobile & tablet: up to 1024px.
- Desktop: from 1024px.

Follow the guidelines of the given design, including:

- Colors
- Typographies: font face (as Helvetica Neue is a paid font, you may use a similar one like Open Sans), size and weight.
- Layout: composition and space between elements, for the 2 given screen sizes.
